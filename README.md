# technical-test
A basic level technical test for applicants for a QA position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technical test has one goal and one rule:

THE GOAL:
- Make all the unit tests in the 'TechnicalTestUnitTests' project pass

THE RULE:
- Achieve the goal by ONLY modifying (the code in) the 'TechnicalTestCore' project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HANDING IN THE TEST RESULTS:

P.S.
If you have applied for a QA position and have been asked to do this test, please
bear in mind:
We are aware that the technical skill of QA professionals varies greatly. The test
will be trivial for some and very hard for others. As such not being able to
complete the entire test doesn't mean your application won't be considered. We'd
just like to see how far you did get.
