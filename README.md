# technical-test
A basic level technical test for applicants for a QA position

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The technical test has one goal and one rule:

THE GOAL:
- Make all the unit tests in the 'TechnicalTestUnitTests' project pass

THE RULE:
- Achieve the goal by ONLY modifying (the code in) the 'TechnicalTestCore' project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HANDING IN THE TEST RESULTS:
There are two ways to hand in the exercise:
1. Make a .zip or .7z of our solution and email it to your contact at the office
2. For bonus points:
2.1 Create a new branch off master with your own name as branch name
2.2 Commit your solution to the technical test to your branch
2.3 Create a pull request to merge your branch to master

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P.S.
If you have applied for a QA position and have been asked to do this test, please
bear in mind:
We are aware that the technical skill of QA professionals varies greatly. The test
will be very easy for some and very hard for others. As such not being able to
complete the entire test doesn't mean your application won't be considered. We'd
just like to see how far you did get.
